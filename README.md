# learning-css based on the course Introduction to CSS3 by  University of Michigan
 This course is aimed for students who have a basic understanding of HTML, 
 and are ready to take that knowledge and create nicely styled web pages. 
 Unlike other courses where the learning tends to be theoretical, 
 this course will be EXTREMELY hands-on. 
 You will learn how to write CSS3 rules for headings, paragraph, images, 
 and even for special elements called pseudo-elements. 
 You will add a little bit of interactivity to your page and maybe even an animation or two. 
 When you are done, you will have taken a plain three page web site and 
 turned it into something that has a professional look.
